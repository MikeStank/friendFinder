              <p>Question 1: </p>
                <div>
                  When someone chews loudly, you feel like you'd rather have someone stab your eardrums with pencils.
                </div>
          </li>

          <li class="qbox">
              <p>Question 2: </p>
              <div>
                You find yourself questioning your existence about every 5 to 10 minutes and each time makes you feel a little worse than before.
              </div>
          </li>

          <li class="qbox">
              <p>Question 3: </p>
              <div>
                  When the dog won't stop barking, the most acceptable and sure-fire way to make them stop is to bark back as loud as possible.
              </div>
          </li>

          <li class="qbox">
              <p>Question 4: </p>
              <div>
                  You don't have many pet-peeves, but you really don't like it when people use their pencil eraser too loudly.
              </div>
          </li>

          <li class="qbox">
              <p>Question 5: </p>
              <div>
                  Every morning when you wake up, the first words out of your mouth are astonishingly vulgar and offensive.
              </div>
          </li>

          <li class="qbox">
              <p>Question 6: </p>
              <div>
                  It'd be totally fine if people slurped when they ate cereal or soup, as long as I could shoot spit wads at them while they did it.
              </div>
          </li>

          <li class="qbox">
              <p>Question 7: </p>
              <div>
                  Although you enjoy peoples' company, you'd rather not...
              </div>

          <li class="qbox">
              <p>Question 8: </p>
              <div>
                  The thought of your roommate from 6 years ago eating the frozen pizza that you specifically told them not to eat, still bothers you from time to time.
              </div>
          </li>

          <li class="qbox">
              <p>Question 9: </p>
              <div>
                  People that go "AHHHHHHHHHH" after every drink shouldn't be able to drink in front of people.
              </div>
          </li>

          <li class="qbox">
              <p>Question 10: </p>
              <div>
                  After 9 questions on this dating app, you're kind of questioning whether you actually should meet someone here.
              </div>
          </li>
