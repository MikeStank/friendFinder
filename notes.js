// Aesthetics
// 1.) A form with 10 questions and each question has 5 bubbles to choose from to the right
// 2.) New question pops up on the page, overwriting the one prior (document.write)?
// 3.) Questions are appended over one another like a homework sha384-0mSbJDEHialfmuBBQP6A4Qrprq5OVfW37PRR3j5ELqxss1yVqOtnepnHVP9aJ7xS

// Form idea = seems most difficult, but maybe think it through. Feel like it would be easier to store the information by choosing a number that way. Would likely look the best as well.
// Overwrite idea = ...kind of ok, a little goofy. Could put a new picture above each new question, making it have a chance to be funnier.
// Append idea = boring. Probably the easiest when it comes down to it, though.
